# Credits
Thanks to [ShivaliGoel](https://github.com/ShivaliGoel/Quotes-500K) for their dataset with quotes.
We converted their csv to a tsv (tab separated file), and kept only the quote and author fields.

Thanks to [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/) for their quote-to-speech framework, Deepspeech.
We are glad to see that there do exist good quality general-purpose neural networks.

Thanks to [Python](https://www.python.org/) for existing.
This made our work quite a lot easier.

Thanks to [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) for their GUI implementation.
Thanks to [pyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) for providing Python bindings for Qt5.
However, also anti-thanks for not implementing all bindings (e.g. `qquickstyle`) with same names as official Qt5 C++ bindings.

Thank to [Bethesda](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/) for making [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim) and all accompanying dlc's.
