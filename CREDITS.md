# Credits
Thanks to [ShivaliGoel](https://github.com/ShivaliGoel/Quotes-500K) for their dataset with quotes.
We converted their csv to a tsv (tab separated file), and kept only the quote and author fields.

Thanks to [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/) for their quote-to-speech framework, Deepspeech.
We are glad to see that there do exist good quality general-purpose neural networks.

Thanks to [Python](https://www.python.org/) for existing.
This made our work quite a lot easier.

Thanks to [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) for their GUI implementation.
Thanks to [pyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) for providing Python bindings for Qt5.
However, also anti-thanks for not implementing all bindings (e.g. `qquickstyle`) with same names as official Qt5 C++ bindings.

Thanks to [Bethesda](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/) for making [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim) and all accompanying dlc's.

Thanks to the xEdit team ([ElminsterAU](http://www.nexusmods.com/users/167469/?), [Hlp](http://www.nexusmods.com/users/1102380/?), [Zilav](http://www.nexusmods.com/users/156622/?) and [Sharlikran](http://www.nexusmods.com/users/4147439/?)) for the creation of [TESVEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859). With this tool, I extracted all subtitles text from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, which I then edited to be used for quotes.

<!-- Credit for extracting audio files still needed -->

Thanks to [greentea101](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/974272) and AutoHotKey for their work on the mod [Unfuzer cpp edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19242). I used this unstable tool to convert all .fuz files (audio files containing speech of in-game characters)
to .wav files.

Thanks to [The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/) for documenting the The Elder Scrolls game series so well, and to provide such clear hyperlink resolvers.
