Status update:
Found a dataset containing quotes named [Quotes-500K](https://github.com/ShivaliGoel/Quotes-500K).
It is rather raw, ill-structured and contains non-English quotes, and quotes which are way too long.
With enough refinement, however, it is an adequate dataset to show the ability of dynamic loading, once I implement that.

Implemented a basic dynamic loader, but should be improved before calling it finished.
The protocol is to look for datasets, and then find dynamic Python modules in `dynamic` folder.
This should probably be the other way around.

In the near future, I will start on main infrastructure, UI, and continue on dynamic loading.

## TODO
The following things need to be worked on:
 * Main infrastructure
 * Main UI
 * Dynamic loading of datasets

## Done
The following items are complete:
 * Construct dataset for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
 * Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
 * Text-to-speech implementation
 * Dataset with famous quotes
