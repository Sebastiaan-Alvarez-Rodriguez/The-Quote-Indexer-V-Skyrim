Until now, there were no audio files to play back when a quote was matched.
From this point on, this is possible.
With much difficulty, and a tool named [B.A.E](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/974/) (Bethesda Archive Extracter),
I extracted the games spoken audio files.
Then, I converted them from their strange formatting to WAV using the tool [Unfuzer cpp edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19242),
which is highly unstable.

As a result for all of this effort, I got a dataset of WAV files.
In the skyrim-quotes-dataset, there is a path from each dialogue to a file containing the right audio.
With some trivial manipulations, those paths can be used to index the all new extracted-audio-dataset.

During generation of the audio-dataset, we missed some dialogue audio files somehow (probably the tools).
So, not every quote has an audio file.

Also, this dataset is more than 20GB large, which is about as much as the entire game. This extraction was pricey.
I might want to look into compressing the WAV files somehow.
