I Installed [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/) and learned to develop with its Python bindings.
Also, I used a program named [TES5Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859) to extract all English dialogue subtitles from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
Finally, I wrote a little program to transform the raw data into an orderly tab-separated file without redundancy, to compress this dataset.
Once I have more time, I will continue work
