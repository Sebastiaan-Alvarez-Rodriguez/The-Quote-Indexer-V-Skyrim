Main infrastructure is stable. First fun thing implemented: Hyperlinking.
I used [The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/) to serve informational pages on characters speaking quotes.
So, hyperlinking to online pages is implemented!

De-horrified UI. First, it was a complete mess. Now, everything is constructed in an orderly, overviewable fashion.
Created a UI-handler, which sets all callbacks, and handles interaction between UI and code in a streamlined manner.
The main UI is finished now.

Finally, transformed weird names (such as `DLC2BanditPillarWorker`) to normal names (such as `Bandit`).

Soon, I will start developping more fun things (play spoken quotes, dark theme).

## TODO
The following things need to be worked on:
 * Play spoken quotes
 * Dark theme

## Done
The following items are complete:
 * Construct dataset for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
 * Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
 * Text-to-speech implementation
 * Dataset with famous quotes
 * Main infrastructure
 * Main UI
 * Dynamic loading of datasets
 * Hyperlinking to relevant online pages
