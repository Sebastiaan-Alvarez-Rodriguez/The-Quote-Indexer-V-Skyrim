Today, I implemented Voice Activity Detection for DeepSpeech, and made an implementation to get speech-to-text in Python, using Deepspeech.
Also, I started thinking on a user interface. 
This program will most likely support desktops and laptops, and is (ideally) operating system independent.
To support this, the UI must be operating system independent, too.

Since I have no experience in developping user interfaces for pc, the UI must be simple.
Maybe I will use [pyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt).

## TODO
The following things need to be worked on:
 * Main infrastructure
 * Main UI
 * Dynamic loading of datasets
 * Dataset with famous quotes

## Done
The following items are complete:
 * Construct dataset for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
 * Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
 * Text-to-speech implementation
