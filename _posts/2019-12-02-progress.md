Main infrastructure is getting pretty stable. Basic UI is setup.
Further refinement in the 500K dataset (only 77759 quotes left).

Dynamic loading now works by checking out the dynamic modules.
When it is being loaded, it checks where the database is to be loaded by checking the configs in `configs` directory.
For more detailed information, check out the [dynamic loading protocol](https://sebastiaan-alvarez-rodriguez.github.io/The-Quote-Indexer-V-Skyrim/#dynamic-loading-protocol) on the main page.

Soon, I can start developping the fun things (Hyperlinking to relevant online pages, playing spoken quotes).
